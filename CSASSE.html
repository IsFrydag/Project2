                <p>Focus:</p>

                <p>Client-side
                Typically, client-side development is user-focused, while server-side development occurs when users cant see it. Client-side developers focus on creating the parts of a website or application that users can view, such as visual design elements and webpage layouts.</p>

                <p>Server-side
                Server-side developers focus on more hidden components, such as how an application transmits data to a server. Client-side code is often visible to the user, while server-side is invisible.</p>

                <p>Purpose:</p>

                <p>Client-side
                The primary goal of client-side development is to create visual effects and elements for websites, including layouts and user interfaces.</p>

                <p>Server-side
                Server-side development focuses on the actual content of a webpage, involving tasks like interacting with databases and retrieving information from a web server.</p>

                <p>User Input:</p>
                
                <p>Client-side
                Client-side development gathers input from users. For example, developers can use JavaScript to create forms that collect user input.</p>

                <p>Server-side
                Server-side development processes this input. For example, developers can use PHP to connect a database to a website and send user-inputted data to the database. In this way, client-side and server-side programs can work together.</p>
