                <p><b>Why was the Internet created?</b> In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States was engaged in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Each country was working to increase the science and technology capabilities to prevent nuclear attacks from each other, and also remain capable of attacking the other, should the situation devolve. At the time computers were much larger and more expensive than todayâ€™s models. Mainframe computers took up entire rooms and were only able to do specific tasks. Researchers needed to be able to use computers to perform these tasks but often had to travel long distances to find a computer to do a specific task. The proposed solution was a way to connect the computers so they could speak to each other, allowing researchers to share data without needing to travel to the location of the computer.

                <p><b>How was the Internet created?</b> The problem with having computers communicate with each other was the method of transferring data from one computer to another, circuit switching, which took a long time and could easily be interrupted. All the data needed to be sent in one packet, none of the data would get through. With packet s3witching the data could be sent individually. Once the data reached its destination, the packets were able to be reassembled into a complete packet.

                <p><b>When did the Internet start?</b> In 1969, the first computers communicated over ARPANET from UCLA to SRI in California. This initial network only had four nodes, but more were added to allow research universities to share data and other resources. After ARPANET, other networks were developed, but individual networks could not communicate with each other. For this problem to be resolved, a set of rules called the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol were developed, known as TCP/IP. These rules allowed universal communication across all networks, an make sure packets sent over a network would be delivered to the correct destination.

                <p><b>When was the Internet introduced to the public?</b> In 1991 the World Wide Web was launched. The Web allows users from any connected computer to locate resources and web pages using Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs. The URL functions as an address that tells the computer where to find the resource on the internet. The Web also uses HTTP, to enable users to download linked resources and HTML, Markup Language, and formatting languages for web pages.
