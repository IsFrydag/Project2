            <div class="text1">

                <p>WWW architecture is divided into several layers as shown in the following diagram:</p>

                <p>Identifiers and Character Set
                Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is used to uniquely identify resources on the web and UNICODE makes it possible to build web pages that can be read and written in human languages.</p>
            
                <p>Syntax
                XML (Extensible Markup Language) helps to define common syntax in the semantic web.</p>

                <p>Data Interchange
                Resource Description Framework (RDF) framework helps in defining the core representation of data for the web. RDF represents data about resources in graph form.</p>
            
                <p>Taxonomies
                RDF Schema (RDFS) allows more standardized description of taxonomies and other ontological constructs.</p>

                <p>Ontologies</p>
                <p>Web Ontology Language (OWL) offers more constructs than RDFS. It comes in the following three versions:
                OWL Lite for taxonomies and simple constraints.
                OWL DL for full description logic support.
                OWL for more syntactic freedom of RDF
                </p>

                <p>Rules
                RIF and SWRL offer rules beyond the constructs that are available from RDFs and OWL. Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) is a SQL-like language used for querying RDF data and OWL Ontologies.</p>

                <p>Proof
                All semantics and rules that are executed at layers below Proof and their result will be used to prove deductions.</p>
            
                <p>Cryptography
                Cryptography means such as digital signature for verification of the origin of sources used.</p>

                <p>User Interface and Applications
                On the top of the layer User interface and Applications layer are built for user interaction.</p>
